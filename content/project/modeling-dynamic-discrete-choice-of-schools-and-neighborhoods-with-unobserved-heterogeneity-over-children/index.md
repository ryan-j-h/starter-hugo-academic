School quality is often central to neighborhood choice. However, it will matter different amounts to different types of people. When thinking of neighborhood choice as a dynamic problem, there may be three distinct types: (1) people who currently have school-age kids, (2) people who plan to have kids in the future (or want to keep that option open), and (3) people who do not want to have kids or have kids that have completed their education. If data on children is unobserved when constructing models of neighborhood choice, especially when they are being used to estimate the amenity value of school quality, it could be useful to allow the value to vary across types. It would likely be hard to identify these three different types from the data, however, because their choice patterns may not look all that different since school quality is one of many considerations that go into neighborhood choice. Another set of types to consider in the same problem are those who would send their children to public schools vs. private schools.
